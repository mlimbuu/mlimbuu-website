  title={Team coordination on graphs with state-dependent edge costs},
  author={Limbu, Manshi and Hu, Zechen and Oughourli, Sara and Wang, Xuan and Xiao, Xuesu and Shishika, Daigo},
  abstract={This paper studies a team coordination problem
in a graph environment. Specifically, we incorporate “support”
action which an agent can take to reduce the cost for its
teammate to traverse some high cost edges. Due to this added
feature, the graph traversal is no longer a standard multi-agent
path planning problem. To solve this new problem, we propose
a novel formulation that poses it as a planning problem in a
joint state space: the joint state graph (JSG). Since the edges
of JSG implicitly incorporate the support actions taken by the
agents, we are able to now optimize the joint actions by solving a
standard single-agent path planning problem in JSG. One main
drawback of this approach is the curse of dimensionality in both
the number of agents and the size of the graph. To improve
scalability in graph size, we further propose a hierarchical
decomposition method to perform path planning in two levels.
We provide both theoretical and empirical complexity analyses
to demonstrate the efficiency of our two algorithms.},

  title={Human-robot teaming on graphs with state-dependent edge cost.},
  author={Limbu, Manshi and Hu, Zechen and Oughourli, Sara and Wang, Xuan and Xiao, Xuesu and Shishika, Daigo},
  abstract={We are interested in designing coordinated group motion,
where the safety or cost for one agent to move from one
location to another may depend on the support provided by
its teammate. For example, consider a scenario where a team
of human and robot must traverse an environment with some
“risk” edges as shown in Fig. 1. Those risks might represent
actions such as going up a ladder, crossing a "shaky" bridge,
or walking through a dark tunnel. In these situations, a human
(or robot) teammate can support the other by holding the
ladder, stabilizing the bridge, or lighting up the tunnel. We
capture the feasibility of these "supporting" actions in the
green dashed arrows in Fig. 1, extending from the nodes
from which the support can be provided. The core questions
we seek to answer are: (i) when such support/coordination
is beneficial, and (ii) how to best coordinate the actions as
a team to minimize the overall cost.
We formulate a problem that incorporates support actions
to a minimum-cost graph traversal problem. We then propose
a solution approach based on the notion of joint state graph
(JSG) formulation, converting the problem into single-agent
path planning. To address the curse of dimensionality, a
hierarchical decomposition method based on Critical Joint
State Graph (CJSG) is introduced for two-level planning.
Complexity and statistical analyses demonstrate the efficacy
of our algorithm.},
