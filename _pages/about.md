Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My research interests are machine learning and reinforcement learning on graphs for multi-agents. My current research is focused on developing algorithmns to optimize strategic coordination/cooperation among goal oriented multi- agents using graph neural networks and multi-agent reinforcement Learning. Iâ€™m also interested in improving generalization and sample efficiency of learning agents, with focus on transfer learning and meta learning to optimize agents adaptibility to new tasks and environments.

Previously I worked at [Fusemachines](https://fusemachines.com/) as Software/Devops Engineer. I completed my BS in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Tribhuvan University, Nepal.
